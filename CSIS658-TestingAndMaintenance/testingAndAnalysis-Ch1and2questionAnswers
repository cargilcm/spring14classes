As a feasibility study involved some degree of architectural design, integrating 
steps for QA during this phase of estimating on a project can ensure allocation 
of quality objectives into appropriate subsystems development teams and foster 
better detail specifications, according to incremeneted deliverables, early on.  
Identifying specific responsibilities as corresponds to subsystem groups, 
earlier, allows each group to build their implementation to a more precise level
of detail.
