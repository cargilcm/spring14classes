1.4) When a spiral model employing incremental prototyping phases for risk reduction is paired with architectural design for testability using a build order that supports testing after each stage of construction is used, a conflict might arise in the prioritization of each functional aspect of the system as to when it is implemented.  For example, an integral aspect to the architecture of a web chat client at a lower-level may seem less critical when using a prototyping approach that focuses more on the GUI.  If the architectural plan is developed and implemented in unison, the prototype may be demonstrative of changes to architectural design, using say SMS (text-messaging protocol) from the get-go and GUI implementations based on the design developed throughout.

1.5) Doubling MTBF would seem the more optimal choice to reducing customers' frustration due to disrupted downloads of the classic movies, for they can more confidently initiate downloads and leave their download machines unattended.  If availability is increased yet there are more, say 1-minutes system failures, during say, peak time, more customers will have likely experienced failed downloads due to disruption and more of them, at least, will be further frustrated and likely to abandon recording download services.
